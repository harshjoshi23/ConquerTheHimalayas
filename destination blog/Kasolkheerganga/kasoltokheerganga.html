THE TRIP<br>
For this trip, we took a bus from the R.K. Ashram Marg metro station at around 7pm. There were so many people in the bus and we had around of introduction nd there was this guy who had brought a guitar along with him and all of us started singing and having fun. At around 10 pm, we stopped at Murthal Dhaba to grab a bite and just freshen up. It was so lively there and the food there was just delicious. But remember not to stuff yourself too much with it or you might end up with discomfort !! xD</p>

	<h2>DAY 1:</h2>
	<p>
		We reached Kasol at around 9:30 am the following morning. 
		We were an hour late from our scheduled time as we had stopped for breakfast on our way down here. 
		After stepping out of the bus, my friends and I headed to the hotel. We just freshened up 
		ourselves and after taking some rest, we then went out in the beautiful Parvati Woods to explore and feel 
		the beauty of this dreamlike nature. The beautiful sight seemed to be so surreal that one could not just get enough of it. 
		It was pure bliss. We sat by the valley adoring the wonderful sight, visited the local markets and bought some souvenirs for our families. 
		In the evening we went to the Evergreen Café, which is quite popular because of its trippy and psychedelic vibe with all the live music sessions and all. 
		The café was not very expensive as we had to pay around 450 per person.</p>

	<h2>DAY 2:</h2>
		<p>
		It was now time for the much awaited Kheerganga trek. It is a 11-km trek. We had a light yet nutritious breakfast and started the trek at around 10 am. We started the trek and after one and a half hour, we reached the base camp that was Barshaini. From here we purchased the sticks that helped us a lot in trekking. Also this is the point where you start loosing signals, so it’s better to call up your family and inform them that you won’t be able to keep in touch with them till the next day. The trek is filled with small eating joints and the steaming hot maggi there just can’t be missed!! It is a very different vibe out there. Even if you start feeling exhausted and tired, you just look around and everyone is just so enthusiastic and the music that many of them were playing from their portable speakers just lifts up the mood and your spirit. After 7 hours of climbing the rocks and looking out to not slip down due to the slippery ground, we finally made it!!! After reaching at the top, all your tiredness just vanishes and it seems like worth it. The view is just breathtaking. We then settles down in our camps for a while and then in the night we went to one of the cafes up there and had some delicious snacks and then the camp there was a bonfire arranged. Everyone sat around it and we sang our hearts out. After all this, we finally went to sleep</p><br>
		<h2>DAY 3:</h2>
		<P>
		We woke up to a beautiful morning and then went to the Manikaran Temple up there, which also has a hot spring. After having the breakfast, we started for the trek on our way back to the base camp Barshaini. At Barshaini, we went to the ‘Manikaran Sahib Gurudwara’. After paying respect at the Gurudwara, we went out and savoured some of the street food there. We then again started the downtrek to Kasol. At around 8 pm we boarded our bus for our way back to Delhi, which dropped us to the RK Ashram Marg metro station.
		I just want to say that if you love the mountains and want to get some peace, then this trek is for you. The journey at each point is so scenic. The vibe there is something else. Do take a weekend out in summer and do visit this little paradise!
