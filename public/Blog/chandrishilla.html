                <p class="lead"> Chopta Chandrashila Deoria Tal trekking tour promises refreshing and heart filled pleasure which makes the destination so attractive to millions of visitors throughout the year. Chopta is a small region of meadows and evergreen forest area which is a part of Kedarnath wildlife sanctuary located in Uttarakhand state. The reason for its popularity is the lovely campsites, where every site is unique in its own way and does not match the beauty with any other campsites in the journey</p>

                    Chopta will be the starting point of the trek. Travellers will be taken to the starting point of trail at morning. It's a 3 hours trek to Tungnath Mahadev temple(World's highest shiva temple) and 1.5 hours more to Chandrishilla Peak as the trail is moderately difficult at some places.
                    You'll have a 360 degree view of Chaukhamba Peak from Chandrishilla top and it is the only hike with this level of altitude variation in just few hours.

            <div class="container py-4">
                <p class="lead">
                    The trek starts from Sari village few Km away from Ukhimat. It's a 2 hour terk for an average person. Trek route delights in a windy trail through rich forests, snow-laden trail with patches of green during the summer season are to come across and you can also witness several peaks and ranges. The base camp on the trek comes with Deoriatal.
                    The beauty of this place can't be expresssed in words and the snow covered chaukhamba peak is an add on beauty to it. We advise one day camp near deoriatal at our camps and travel to chopta the next day though it can be modified accordingly.<br>

                <h3>Deoriatal - chopta via rohini bugyal</h3>
                The distance coverd in this trek is around 17 km from our campsite. The trek leads through beautiful forests and after half way walking you reach the beautiful meadows (Rohini bugyal) usually it used to be a 2 days trek till 2016 with a one night hault at Rohini bugyal but because government has restricted camping in that area so we cover it in one day.
                If a person is physically fit so he/she can cover this trek in 7 hours after taking some small haults.
