            Nestled at an altitude of 5,577 feet (1,700 meters) in the Kangra district of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, McLeod Ganj is an enchanting hill station sitting in the lap of Dhauladhar range. Referred to as India’s Mini Tibet, the area is rife with Tibetan culture, quaint streets, charming monasteries, olde worlde cafes and an abundance of scenic natural beauty coupled with spiritual and tranquil vibes. 
            <br>
            Dharamsala became a center of Tibetan Buddhism in a predominantly Hindu area after the Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 and was allowed to resettle in the Indian city. Since then, thousands of Tibetans have followed, settling especially in the McLeod Ganj area of Dharamsala, and their culture and history has come to not only influence but also define the city.

        <P>The prominence of Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries can be seen throughout the area, such as the Kalachakra Temple, whose vibrant green and red tiers and golden carvings bursts onto the McLeod Ganj street scene. The Tsuglagkhang Complex is relatively simple, with a homey style, but as the residence of the Dalai Lama it is a must-see place, especially for the rich history, art, tradition, and culture that lies within. The Norbulingka Monastery is more traditional, with a large red wooden gate at its entrance,  and a giant gilded statue of the Buddha.

            <br>  The city is dominated by prayer flags whose colors erupt across the city like silent fireworks. But the flags serve a higher purpose than beauty. Covered in mantras, it is believed that as the flags flutter peacefully in the breeze, the wind will spread the compassion of these prayers into all space. To be surrounded by prayer flags is to not only feel like you’ve walked into a kaleidoscope, but also a way to be blessed by their mantras. Admiring prayer flags – where bold bright new cloth is strung alongside faded tattered old flags – is bearing witness grander philosophy: the ongoing cycle of life, and how we all become part of the universe.The Tibetan Buddhist population are the majority here. Others include the mountainous people belonging to Gaddi community and Christians who settled here since the colonial rule.So McLeod-Ganj is a must visit for everyone looking to experience tranquility in the mist of nature.
