COOKING STEPS WITH PICTURES:-</h1>
<p>
1. In a bowl take suji, sugar and ghee, mix them nicely and keep the mixture aside for at least one hour for soaking. After an hour the suji mixture will become soft. Add milk to the mixture and mix well so that batter is prepared of pouring consistency. It is important to beat the batter with your hands several times for around 10 minutes so that it becomes frothy and air penetrates in it, so that when you fry the pua it can rise.
