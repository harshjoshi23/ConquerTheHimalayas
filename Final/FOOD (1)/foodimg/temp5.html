<p>Palak ka Kappa is very popular tasty curry from Kumaon region. I have never met an kumaoni who forgets this recipe while mentioning his favorite local cuisine. This is a nutritious recipe as it is made of spinach thus rich in iron. Palak kappa also goes well with most of the kumaoni dals/lentils as an accompainement. It is accompanied with ras-bhaat, dubke,chudkani and the list goes on. Traditionally palak kappa is made in iron wok and this enhances the green color and make it more dark. As I do not have a pure iron wok, I have cooked in steel pan and thus you might feel a difference in color.<br>

	<P>2. Now add gram flour to the pan and let the gram flour roast for a minute or so, until the raw taste goes away. Now pour 1/4th cup of water and let it come to a boil. Add chopped spinach and mix in the gram flour mixture.<br>
  
        3. Add salt, turmeric powder and red chilli powder to this. While cooking spinach it is important to keep in mind that spinach reduces a lot from the initial amount, so you be careful with the amount of salt. Once the spinach is well coated and reduced around 1/4 cup of water. Now on low to medium flame let this cook for 15- 20 minutes.
