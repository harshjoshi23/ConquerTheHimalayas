      <h1>AALOO TAMATAR JHOL:</h1>
      <p>Aaloo Tamatar Jhol is a very easy potato tomato curry made widely in Kumaon. It serves as a simple curry for main course meals or it can be an acompaniment with poori and parathas. This recipe used to my Ammma’s (grandmother)almost daily meal. She liked this recipe with minimal spices as it was light and tasty. I like it best with pooris accompanied with raita.<br>

      <h1>JHOLI BHAT</h1>
      <p> Jholi bhat is very popular Kumaoni dish. It is very similar to the punjabi kadi. However, in a traditional jholi jamboo(Allium stracheyi) is also added which is a spice/herb grown in Himalayan regions. It is used extensively in authentic kumaoni cusine, however it is not so easy to find outside the kuamon region. Hence the recipe below is made without jamboo.<br>

      <h1>Kumaoni Kheera Raita</h1>
      <p>Kheera raita or cucumber yoghurt is a popular recipe made as a side-dish. However, a traditional kumaoni raita is more spicy and sharp. Though the main ingredients are same cucumber and yoghurt, but there are few extra spices that give the kumaoni raita a sharp edge. “Raita” word is actually made from rai or mustard.  <br>

      <h1>Palak Ka Kappa</h1>
      <p>Palak ka Kappa is very popular tasty curry from Kumaon region. I have never met an kumaoni who forgets this recipe while mentioning his favorite local cuisine. This is a nutritious recipe as it is made of spinach thus rich in iron. Palak kappa also goes well with most of the kumaoni dals/lentils as an accompainement. <br>

      <h1>Aaloo ke Gutke</h1>
    <p> Aaloo Ke Gutke is a very popular Kumaoni recipe. This can be eaten as a snack with bhaang ki chatni, pudina-dhania hari chutney (green chutney). Also when you travel in the kumaoni hills it is served with kumaoni style raita. Wow, even while writing I can feel the taste of aaloo-raita which I used to eat at stopovers while travelling to my college in Dwarahat.<br>
