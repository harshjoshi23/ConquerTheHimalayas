<p>Aaloo Tamatar Jhol is a very easy potato tomato curry made widely in Kumaon. It serves as a simple curry for main course meals or it can be an acompaniment with poori and parathas. This recipe used to my Ammmaâ€™s (grandmother)almost daily meal. She liked this recipe with minimal spices as it was light and tasty. I like it best with pooris accompanied with raita.<br>
