    Jholi bhat is very popular Kumaoni dish. It is very similar to the punjabi kadi. However, in a traditional jholi jamboo(Allium stracheyi) is also added which is a spice/herb grown in Himalayan regions. It is used extensively in authentic kumaoni cusine, however it is not so easy to find outside the kuamon region. Hence the recipe below is made without jamboo. Gramflour and curd gravy with pakoras/dumplings served with basmati rice and chutney are a perfect lunch for a weekend.<br>

Cooking Time:30 Mins<br>

    1. In a bowl mix all the ingredients well with a spoon. Add water in small amounts to make a thick batter.<br>
    2. Heat some oil in pan for frying. Make small pakoras/dumplings of the batter using your fingers, and gently drop them in oil. Once they sizzle flip them over to cook the bottom side.<br>

	<P>1. In a big bowl take gram flour, red chilli powder, turmeric,salt and asafeotida. Add few tbsps water and make a thick paste. Now add curd to it and with a spoon/form make a fine batter with no lumps. Keep this aside.<BR>
        2. In a broad pan/wok heat oil and add cumin seeds and dried red chillies. To this add mustard seeds.Once the red chillies are well fried and finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chilli.<br>
        3. Once the garlic is light brown add the curd-gram flour mix and stir continuously. Now let this cook for 2-3 minutes with continuous stirring. After this add 2 cups water and with a wooden spatula mix it well so that you get a smooth consistency.<br>
        4. Let this simmer on medium flame for next 10-12 minutes. Add the pakoras and immerse them using a spatula. Let this simmer for next 5 minutes.Now remove the pan from heat and cover the jholi/kadi so that pakoras can absorb the mix, and let it stay for 3-4 minutes.
