<p>Aaloo Ke Gutke is a very popular Kumaoni recipe. This can be eaten as a snack with bhaang ki chatni, pudina-dhania hari chutney (green chutney). Also when you travel in the kumaoni hills it is served with kumaoni style raita. Wow, even while writing I can feel the taste of aaloo-raita which I used to eat at stopovers while travelling to my college in Dwarahat. Aaloo ke gutke are also served with poori or paratha as a breakfast meal, then we would call it poori aaloo. I remember taking poori aaloo for school picnics. It is very easy to make and quick recipe. As it has no onion or garlic, it is also made on fasting days for dinner when the fast is concluded at night.<br>

COOKING STEPS WITH PICTURES:-</h1>
<p>
        1. Boil the potatoes. I used pressure cooker and after 2 whistles of cooker I closed the flame. Let the potatoes cool enough so that you can handle them and then peel them and cut into cubes.<br>

        2. Prepare a masala paste, in a small bowl add coriander powder, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt and to this add 2-3 tbsps water to make a paste.

    <P>3. In a pan, pour 2 tbsps mustard oil and let the mustard oil heat enough, else you will feel the raw taste of oil in your final dish. Once the oil is heated add dried red chillies and cumin seeds.<br>
        4. When the chillies are fried and cumin seeds start to splutter. Add some asafeotida and then pour in the masala paste. With a spatula mix the masala paste with oil and cumin seeds and let it cook for 30 secs.Now add the boiled and cut potatoes to this. Mix well, so that all the potatoes are well coated with oil and masala mix. Add finely chopped coriander and let this cook for few minutes.
